    <h1>Introduction to FAN Shell</h1>
    <p>FAN shell is a hobby project that I am writing from scratch in C, in order to learn 
       the inner workings of a shell and to learn how to manage non-trivial projects both in terms of 
       complexity and size. Therefore I intend to maintain this project for a relatively long period 
       of time. For example, that could include implementing external features written in other languages 
       like python or extending the internal capabilities of the shell.
    </p>
