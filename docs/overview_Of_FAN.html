    <h1>How FAN processes input</h1>
        <h2>Initializing argc and argv</h2>
            <p>When the user runs FAN, the sign <b>FAN$</b> followed by the value of PATH is printed to 
                the screen. For example, if you are in <b>/home</b> directory and you run FAN, you 
                will get the following printed to the screen:</p><br>

                <b>FAN$/home:</b><br><br>

                <p>After the user has entered input, FAN stores it in <b>inputWords[]</b>.
                However if the input contains spaces at the beginning, it will ignore them until it
                reaches the first non-space character in the input. If there is no non-space character
                in the input; it does not store anything in <b>inputWords[]</b>. The first non-space character
                that it encounters, it shall store it in <b>inputWords[]</b> all the way until the first space 
                character that it encounters again. The first space character encountered after traversing and storing
                the non-space characters shall also be stored in <b>inputWords[]</b>, but any other spaces after that
                shall be ignored until we reach the first non-space character again or the end of the input. For example:
                </p>

                <div>Input:<b>---Hi-World---!</b></div><br>

                <div>Stored in <b>inputWords[]</b> as follows:<b>Hi World !</b></div><br>

                <div>where <b>-</b> represents space in this example.</div><br>

                <p>FAN then traverses <b>inputWords[]</b> and replaces all the spaces will \0 characters. Afterwards,
                   <b>argc</b>,which represents the total number of words, is counted. Finally, <b>argv</b> will have its 
                   members point to the beginning of each of the words stored in <b>inputWords[]</b>. It is worth
                   mentioning that there was no need for FAN to traverse <b>inputWords[]</b> just to eliminate the 
                   space characters; I could have replaced them while reading user's input. But at the time
                   ,for some reason, traversing the array the second time seemed easier.
                </p>

        <h2>Storing commands</h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever <b>argv</b> is initialized and is non-NULL, that input is stored in a
                    <b>historyBlock struct</b>. The structure is defined as follows:
                </p><br>

                <div>
                    <b>typedef struct historyBlock</b>{<br>
                        &emsp;char* command;<br>
                        &emsp;int* counter;  &emsp;//Points to number of commands currently stored<br>
                        &emsp;struct historyBlock* next;<br>
                        &emsp;struct historyBlock* before;<br>
                    } <b>historyBlock</b>;
                </div><br>
