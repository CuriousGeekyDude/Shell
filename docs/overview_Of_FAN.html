    <h1>How FAN processes input</h1>
        <h2>Initializing argc and argv</h2>
            <p>When the user runs FAN, the sign <b>FAN$</b> followed by the value of PATH is printed to 
                the screen. For example, if you are in <b>/home</b> directory and you run FAN, you 
                will get the following printed to the screen:</p><br>

                <b>FAN$/home:</b><br><br>

                <p>After the user has entered input, FAN stores it in <b>inputWords[]</b>.
                However if the input contains spaces at the beginning, it will ignore them until it
                reaches the first non-space character in the input. If there is no non-space character
                in the input; it does not store anything in <b>inputWords[]</b>. The first non-space character
                that it encounters, it shall store it in <b>inputWords[]</b> all the way until the first space 
                character that it encounters again. The first space character encountered after traversing and storing
                the non-space characters shall also be stored in <b>inputWords[]</b>, but any other spaces after that
                shall be ignored until we reach the first non-space character again or the end of the input. For example:
                </p>

                <div>Input:<b>---Hi-World---!</b></div><br>

                <div>Stored in <b>inputWords[]</b> as follows:<b>Hi World !</b></div><br>

                <div>where <b>-</b> represents space.</div><br>

                <p>FAN then traverses <b>inputWords[]</b> and replaces all the spaces will \0 characters. Afterwards,
                   <b>argc</b>,which represents the total number of words, is counted. Finally, <b>argv</b> will have its 
                   members point to the beginning of each of the words stored in <b>inputWords[]</b>. It is worth
                   mentioning that there was no need for FAN to traverse <b>inputWords[]</b> just to eliminate the 
                   space characters; I could have replaced them while reading user's input. But at the time
                   ,for some reason, traversing the array the second time seemed easier.
                </p>

        <h2>Storing commands</h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever <b>argv</b> is initialized and is non-NULL, the length of the input is 
                    calculated. Then an array of char is dynamically allocated on the heap. Then the 
                    command is copied from <b>inputWords[]</b> to this array. We shall then turn all
                    the <b>\0</b> characters to space character except the last <b>\0</b>. The whole 
                    point of dynamic memory allocation in our case is to have a command whose words 
                    are not seperated by <b>\0</b> characters but by spaces. <b>inputWords[]</b> words
                    are seperated by <b>\0</b> so that <b>argv</b> members can point to the beginning 
                    of these words. The reason for this is that, we can safely pass around <b>argv</b>
                    pointers as they are null terminating strings. If they were not null terminating, 
                    then we would have out of bound errors. So since we cannot change the nulls in 
                    <b>inputWords[]</b>, we have no choice but to dynamically allocate an array for 
                    each command. Another reason for such design is to be able to store the commands.
                    For storing the commands we use <b>historyBlock struct</b>. The structure is 
                    defined as follows:
                </p><br>

                <div>
                    <b>typedef struct historyBlock</b>{<br>
                        &emsp;char* command;<br>
                        &emsp;int* counter;  &emsp;//Points to number of commands currently stored<br>
                        &emsp;struct historyBlock* next;<br>
                        &emsp;struct historyBlock* before;<br>
                    } <b>historyBlock</b>;
                </div><br>
                
                <p>
                    The <b>command</b> member of historyBlock shall now point to the dynamically allocated array.
                    Each time a new command is pointed to by <b>command</b>, a statically allocated variable that 
                    <b>counter</b> points to shall be incremented. The purpose of other members is obvious based
                    on their names and types. Therefore the commands are stored by structures that are linked 
                    together like double linked lists. At some point(not yet implemented) whenever the user presses
                    up or down, the previous commands will be printed on the screen. We can have at most 100 of these
                    structures stored on the heap. Consequently, only the last 100 previous commands will be stored. 
                    Whenever the maximum limit is reached, the 100th command is deleted so that we open up space for 
                    the newly typed command.
                </p>

        <h2>Counting &&, ||, ; characters</h2>

                <p>
                    Both here and in the code, I refer to <b>&&</b>, <b>||</b>, <b>;</b> as special characters. I also refer to <b>|</b> and <b>></b> as 
                    special characters as well. But for this section special character is only meant to refer to <b>&&</b>, <b>||</b>,
                    and <b>;</b>. After storing the command in a historyBlock structure, we shall scan it in order to count               
                    how many special characters are present in it.
                </p>
